# AI Final Project: Customer Service Model

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can learn from a dataset to provide good customer service. The goal is to create a small Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that demonstrates the model's capabilities and earns a good grade while also being an enjoyable project.

## Objectives

- Develop a machine learning model for customer service.
- Train the model using a relevant dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance.
- Create a simple MVP to showcase the model.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Dataset Source Link]
- **Description**: Brief description of the dataset.

## Model Development

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and prepare the data.
2. **Model Selection**: Choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithm.
3. **Training**: Training the model on the dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

## MVP Features

- User interface for interacting with the model.
- Real-time customer service responses.
- Performance metrics display.

## Tools and Technologies

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion

This project will demonstrate the application of machine learning in customer service, providing a practical and fun learning experience.
